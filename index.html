  <h4>About</h4>

  <p> My research explores how disorder, complexity, and atomic-scale structure shape vibrational behavior and thermal transport in materials. I am broadly interested in developing predictive frameworks for phonons in chemically complex systems, where conventional assumptions of periodicity and simplicity begin to break down. By combining first-principles calculations, high-performance computing, and machine learning methods, I aim to understand how vibrational phenomena emerge in disordered and high-entropy materials, and how they can be engineered for energy applications, and ultimately contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future.<br><br>
  
  My doctoral work focuses on the predictive modeling of high-entropy oxides for thermal energy conversion, with an emphasis on phonons, vibrational spectra, and ultra-low thermal conductivity. I use density-functional theory and ab initio phonon methods alongside scalable, high-throughput workflows to study vibrational properties across large compositional spaces. Increasingly, my work integrates machine-learning interatomic potentials and graph-based neural networks to accelerate phonon calculations and enable the study of systems that are otherwise computationally inaccessible.
  A recurring theme in my research is the tradeoff between physical interpretability and computational efficiency. I am particularly drawn to tackling questions such as:<br><br>

  - How can we meaningfully describe vibrational modes in strongly disordered materials? What information is lost when we average over complexity, and what new descriptors are needed to capture emergent thermal behavior?<br>
  - How can AI models be designed to respect physical constraints while still leveraging the richness of large datasets?<br><br>

  Notwithstanding the challenging nature of these questions, I view these not as obstacles, but as opportunities to rethink how we model materials at the atomistic level. These questions are way too broad, alongside which I also study more specific methods for facilitating the understanding of phonons in the context of ``disorder'', including phonon band unfolding, non-analytical corrections, and virtual crystal approximation. My work is inherently collaborative and cross-disciplinary, and I actively engage with experimentalists and theorists through NSF MRSEC and other multi-institutional efforts.<br><br>
  Alongside research, I value teaching and mentorship, and I enjoy guiding students through the conceptual foundations of materials science and computational modeling.<br><br>
  I am always happy to discuss research, cool ideas, or potential collaborations, and I welcome any conversations that challenge me. Feel free to reach out to me!</p>

  <h4>Fun</h4>
I love playing the piano and exploring a wide range of music from the romantic masterpieces of Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt to the evocative contemporary works of Hans Zimmer, Ludovico Einaudi and Yann Tiersen. Occasionally, I enjoy composing minimalistic music pieces of my own, or covering modern songs that resonate with me.<br><br>

Traveling and learning about cultures is a source of constant inspiration for me. I enjoy wandering, uncovering local art, savoring regional cuisine, and find equal delight in absorbing the rhythms of daily life through photography. I also enjoy hiking, camping and skiing, in whatever way I can connect with nature.<br><br>

I have recently discovered a deep appreciation for woodworking, and find it both grounding and rewarding. Learning about CMU's TechSpark makerspace was a natural entry point, and I had the opportunity of being offered the tools and community to turn ideas into some cool tangible objects. Some of my recent projects include a <a href="{{ '/assets/misc/plant-stand.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">plant stand</a>, a minimalist <a href="{{ '/assets/misc/crate.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">wooden crate</a>, and a functional <a href="{{ '/assets/misc/folding-stool-1.JPG' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">folding stool</a> (<a href="{{ '/assets/misc/folding-stool-2.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">folded view</a>).<br><br>

Reading remains a cherished refuge of mine. I am drawn to fiction novels and philosophy, which together enrich my understanding of the world and the human experience. I am also on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122411744-tara-sabet" target="_blank">goodreads</a>!<br>
