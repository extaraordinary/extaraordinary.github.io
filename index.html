  <h4>Bio</h4>

  <p> My research explores how disorder, complexity, and atomic-scale structure shape vibrational behavior and thermal transport in materials. I am broadly interested in developing predictive frameworks for phonons in chemically complex systems, where conventional assumptions of periodicity and simplicity begin to break down. By combining first-principles calculations, high-performance computing, and machine learning methods, I aim to understand how vibrational phenomena emerge in disordered and high-entropy materials, and how they can be engineered for energy applications.<br>
    
      My doctoral work focuses on high-entropy oxides for thermal energy conversion, with an emphasis on phonons, vibrational spectra, and ultra-low thermal conductivity. I use density-functional theory and ab initio phonon methods alongside scalable, high-throughput workflows to study vibrational properties across large compositional spaces. Increasingly, my work integrates machine-learning interatomic potentials and graph-based neural networks to accelerate phonon calculations and enable the study of systems that are otherwise computationally inaccessible.
      A recurring theme in my research is the tradeoff between physical interpretability and computational efficiency. I am particularly drawn to tackling questions such as:<br>

      - How can we meaningfully describe vibrational modes in strongly disordered materials? What information is lost when we average over complexity, and what new descriptors are needed to capture emergent thermal behavior?<br>
      - How can AI models be designed to respect physical constraints while still leveraging the richness of large datasets?<br>

      Notwithstanding the challenging nature of these questions, I view these not as obstacles, but as opportunities to rethink how we model materials at the atomistic level. My work is inherently collaborative and cross-disciplinary, and I actively engage with experimentalists and theorists through NSF MRSEC and other multi-institutional efforts. These questions are way too broad, alongside which I also study more specific methods for facilitating the understanding of phonons in the context of ``disorder'', including phonon band unfolding, non-analytical corrections, and virtual crystal approximation.<br>
      
      Alongside research, I value teaching and mentorship, and I enjoy guiding students through the conceptual foundations of materials science and computational modeling.<br>
      
      I am always happy to discuss research, cool ideas, or potential collaborations, and I welcome any conversations that challenge me. Feel free to reach out to me! :)</p>

  <h4>Fun</h4>
I love playing the piano, exxploring a wide range of music from the romantic masterpieces of Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt to the evocative contemporary works of Ludovico Einaudi and Yann Tiersen. Occasionally, I enjoy covering modern songs that resonate with me, or composing minimalistic music.<br><br>

Traveling and learning about diverse cultures is a source of constant inspiration for me. I enjoy uncovering local art, savoring regional cuisine, and find equal delight in absorbing the rhythms of daily life through photography. I also enjoy hiking and camping, in whatever way I can connect with nature.<br><br>

I have recently found joy in woodworking. Learning about CMU's TechSpark was a great starting point for me. You can check out my latest projects here: <a href="{{ "/assets/misc/plant-stand.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">plant stand</a>, <a href="{{ "/assets/misc/crate.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">crate</a>, and <a href="{{ "/assets/misc/folding-stool-1.JPG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">folding stool</a>(<a href="{{ "/assets/misc/folding-stool-2.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">folded</a>).<br><br>

Reading remains a cherished refuge of mine. I am drawn to fiction novels and philosophy, which together enrich my understanding of the world and the human experience.<br>
