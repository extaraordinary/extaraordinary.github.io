  - "Playing the piano has long been a central part of my life. I enjoy exploring a wide range of music that spans from the Romantic era—particularly the works of Chopin and Liszt—to contemporary composers such as Hans Zimmer, Max Richter, Ludovico Einaudi, and Yann Tiersen. Occasionally, I compose minimalist pieces of my own or reinterpret modern songs that resonate with me. You can listen to a Debussy performance by our trio chamber ensemble, as well as our piano quintet's interpretation of Bohemian Rhapsody."
  
  - "Traveling and learning about new cultures constantly inspires me. I find delight in wandering around new places, discovering local art, savoring regional cuisine, and capturing the quiet rythms of daily life through photography. I also enjoy hiking, camping, and skiing; any excuse to be outdoors and feel connected to nature."
