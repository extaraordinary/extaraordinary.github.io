  <h4>About</h4>

  <p>
  My research explores how &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;, complexity, and atomic-scale structure govern compositional 
  stability and heat transport in materials. I am broadly interested in developing predictive 
  frameworks for phonons in chemically complex systems, where conventional assumptions of periodicity and 
  simplicity no longer hold. By integrating first-principles calculations, high-performance computing, and 
  machine learning approaches, I seek to elucidate how vibrational phenomena emerge in disordered materials 
  and how they can be deliberately engineered for energy applications, with the long-term goal of contributing 
  to a more sustainable and equitable future.<br><br>

  My doctoral work centers on the predictive modeling of high-entropy oxides for thermal energy conversion, 
  with a particular emphasis on phonons. <em>Ab initio</em> methods—particularly, density functional theory 
  calculations—are employed with scalable, high-throughput workflows to probe vibrational properties across 
  expansive compositional spaces. Additionally, graph-neural-network-based machine learning interatomic potentials 
  are incorporated to accelerate calculations and facilitate the study of systems that would otherwise be 
  computationally prohibitive.<br><br>
  
  A recurring theme in my research is the tradeoff between physical interpretability and computational 
  efficiency. Within this context, I am particularly motivated by tackling fundamental questions such as: 
  How can one meaningfully define vibrational modes in strongly disordered materials? 
  What information is lost when complexity is described by the parent components, and what new descriptors are 
  required to capture emergent behavior? 
  Likewise, how can ML models be designed to respect physical constraints while leveraging large datasets?<br><br>

  Notwithstanding the challenging nature, I regard these not as obstacles, but as opportunities to rethink 
  how we model materials at the atomistic level. Alongside these already-way-too-broad questions, my work also 
  addresses more targeted methodological approaches to understanding phonons in disordered systems, including 
  phonon band unfolding, non-analytical corrections to the dynamical matrices, and the virtual crystal approximation. 
  My research is inherently collaborative and interdisciplinary, and I actively engage with both experimentalists 
  and theorists within the Center for Nanoscale Science, a National Science Foundation—supported Materials 
  Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), as well as other multi-institutional research efforts.<br><br>

  I am always happy to discuss research, cool ideas, or potential collaborations, and I welcome any 
  conversations that challenge me. Definitely reach out to me! :-) <br><br>

<!-- ========== FUN ========== -->

  <h4>Fun</h4>
  Playing the piano has long been a central part of my life. 
  I enjoy exploring a wide range of music that spans from the Romantic era—particularly the works of 
  Chopin and Liszt—to contemporary composers such as Hans Zimmer, Max Richter, Ludovico Einaudi, and 
  Yann Tiersen. Occasionally, I compose minimalist pieces of my own or reinterpret modern songs that 
  resonate with me. You can listen to a performance of 
  Claude Debussy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUbCEKy-R8c" target="_blank">Piano Trio in G Major</a> 
  by our trio chamber ensemble, as well as our piano quintet's interpretation of 
  Queen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPP6lBkw2GA" target="_blank">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>.<br><br>

  Traveling and learning about new cultures constantly inspires me. 
  I find delight in wandering around new places, discovering local art, savoring regional cuisine, and 
  capturing the quiet rythms of daily life through photography. 
  I also enjoy hiking, camping, and skiing; any excuse to be outdoors and feel connected to nature.<br><br>

  I have recently discovered a deep appreciation for woodworking, and find it truly grounding and rewarding. 
  Learning about CMU's TechSpark makerspace was a natural entry point, and I had the opportunity of benefiting 
  from the tools and community to turn ideas into some cool, tangible objects. Some of my recent projects are 
  a <a href="{{ '/assets/misc/plant-stand.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">plant stand</a>, 
  a minimalist <a href="{{ '/assets/misc/crate.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">wooden crate</a>, 
  and a functional <a href="{{ '/assets/misc/folding-stool-1.JPG' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">folding stool</a> (<a href="{{ '/assets/misc/folding-stool-2.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">folded view</a>).<br><br>

  Reading remains a cherished refuge of mine. I am drawn to fiction novels and philosophy, which together enrich 
  my understanding of the world and the human experience. I cannot begin to describe how much reading has shaped 
  who I am and how I view things since years ago. 
  I am also on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122411744-tara-sabet" target="_blank">goodreads</a>!<br><br>
